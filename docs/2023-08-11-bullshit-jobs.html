<h2 id="brief-summary">Brief Summary</h2>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> bullshit job is one that even the
person doing it secretly believes need not, or should not, exist. That
if the job, or even the whole industry, were to vanish, either it would
make no difference to anyone, or the world might even be a slightly
better place.</p>
<p>David Graeber <span class="citation"

five different categories of job types: flunkies (whose job is to make
the boss feel good), goons (such as corporate lobbyists whose job is to
fight goons from other companies), duct tapers (who fix errors), box
tickers (people who use paperwork or gestures to make it seem like they
are busy) and taskmasters (people who manage but are unneeded). These
jobs exist because people do not want to be accused of being lazy;
modern managers want to justify their jobs and to create a sense of
corporate feudalism. There are five types of bullshit jobs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important,
e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store
greeters, makers of websites whose sites neglect ease of use and speed
for looks;</li>
<li>Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their
employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public
relations specialists, community managers;</li>
<li>Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed
permanently, e.g., programmers repairing bloated code, airline desk
staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive;</li>
<li>Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is
being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house
magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers, quality
service managers;</li>
<li>Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it,
e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lessons-from-the-book">Lessons from the Book</h3>
<p>Many jobs are pointless or most jobs have elements of pointless
activities. Pay attention to the people and the positions they hold. If
you identify any of the five types, do not waste your precious time.
Most importantly if you discover your job is nothing but bs, you must
find ways to deal with its latent consequences. Many people suffered
from bs jobs and others occupied themselves with learning other skills
(e.g. languages, programming, etc.) while holding bs jobs.</p>
