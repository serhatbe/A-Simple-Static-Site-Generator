However older notes, written before that date, are also archived. I primarily write by hand as a means of processing my thoughts and enhancing my comprehension. These notes serve as a valuable reference for both the present and the future, and the daily practice of writing them has become a personal memory tool, especially as I age. ⌘ Index ⌘ About ⌘ Colophon ⌘ Now ⌘ Search ⌘ RSS"

Performance as a practice see page 216. A Ten-Step Approach Stretch Settle down in your environment: Be present, correct posture, breathing. Tune into your heart: Recalling profound feelings is how to tune into your heart. Use your body in a comfortable and natural way. Mechanics, habits and emotions… Follow your curiosity as you practice. Recognize three styles of struggle: Overstated passion, in which we cling to the music. Avoidance, in which we resist dealing with the music. Aggression, in which we attack the music. Drop your attitudes and be simple. Apply three listening techniques: Sing the notes and lines. Place your attention on the vibrations. Place your attention on each sound as it resonates in the space around you. Organize notes into groups, phrases, and textures. Place your attention on the sensations of touch and movement. Key Takeaways Relax, tension is your worst enemy Hear the music you’re playing Be gentle to yourself Do not over practice, short mindful work is superior to long laboured practice sessions. Miscellaneous Notes Swing the music instead of sounding like sewing machine. Group notes and play them by creating a forward motion. Focus on more on the sensations of touch and movement and use your vision mainly to check that what you fe"

That if the job, or even the whole industry, were to vanish, either it would make no difference to anyone, or the world might even be a slightly better place. David Graeber Graeber (2018)lists five different categories of job types: flunkies (whose job is to make the boss feel good), goons (such as corporate lobbyists whose job is to fight goons from other companies), duct tapers (who fix errors), box tickers (people who use paperwork or gestures to make it seem like they are busy) and taskmasters (people who manage but are unneeded). These jobs exist because people do not want to be accused of being lazy; modern managers want to justify their jobs and to create a sense of corporate feudalism. There are five types of bullshit jobs: Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important, e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store greeters, makers of websites whose sites neglect ease of use and speed for looks; Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public relations specialists, community managers; Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed permanently, e.g., programmers repairing bloated code, airline desk "

It’s known for its ease of use and extensive library of packages, called “formulae” (core packages and CLI tools) and “casks” (GUI applications). Here are some of the cool things about Homebrew: Easy Installation: With Homebrew, you can install software and development tools with just one command. No more fussing around! Takes Care of Dependencies: Homebrew automatically takes care of all the software dependencies, so you don’t have to worry about missing any important libraries. Lightweight: Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /opt/homebrew (on Apple Silicon). Community-Driven: Thousands of open-source contributors are always working on Homebrew, making sure that the packages are up-to-date and super secure. Extensible with Casks: Homebrew Cask lets you manage GUI applications. Just type brew install —cask firefox and you’re good to go! Commands Updating homebrew on macOS: brew update Verifying the update: brew --version Upgrading installed packages: brew upgrade Cleaning up unused files: brew cleanup Listing installed packages: brew list Checking the version of pandoc installed via homebrew: brew info pandoc Force Reinstall: brew reinstall obsidian Unlink pandoc: brew unlink pandoc Relink pandoc: brew link pandoc Automate Homebrew Commands #!/bin/bas"

Moment of Inertia Formula The formula for the moment of inertia is: \\[ I = \\int y^2 \\, dA \\] Here: - \\(y\\): distance from the axis of rotation (the base of the rectangle in this case), - \\(dA\\): the infinitesimal area element. 2. Setup for the Rectangle The rectangle has a width of \\(b\\) and height \\(h\\). The height extends from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = h\\). The infinitesimal area element is \\(dA = b \\, dy\\). The integral becomes: \\[ I_{\\text{base}} = \\int_{0}^{h} y^2 \\, b \\, dy \\] 3. Solve the Integral Factor \\(b\\) (constant width) outside of the integral: \\[ I_{\\text{base}} = b \\int_{0}^{h} y^2 \\, dy \\] The integral of \\(y^2\\) is: \\[ \\int y^2 \\, dy = \\frac{y^3}{3} \\] Apply the limits \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = h\\): \\[ I_{\\text{base}} = b \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{h} \\] Substitute the limits: \\[ I_{\\text{base}} = b \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} \\right) \\] Simplify: \\[ I_{\\text{base}} = b \\cdot \\frac{h^3}{3} \\] 4. Final Result The moment of inertia of a rectangle about its base is: \\[ I_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{b h^3}{3} \\] Comparison with the Centroidal Moment of Inertia The moment of inertia about the base is four times greater than that about the centroidal \\(x\\)-axis: \\[ I"

Both approaches work identically, they create isolated Python environments with their own packages and dependencies. The activation commands differ accordingly: .venv/bin/activate for the hidden version venv/bin/activate for the visible version python3 -m venv .venv creates a hidden directory named .venv (the leading dot makes it hidden on Unix systems like macOS). When you run ls in your project directory, you won’t see it unless you use ls -a to show hidden files. python3 -m venv venv creates a visible directory named venv that will show up in normal directory listings. Many developers prefer .venv because: It keeps the project directory cleaner visually It’s less likely to be accidentally committed to version control (though you should add it to .gitignore either way) It follows the convention of hidden configuration files Example 1 python3 -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate pip install pyyaml To exit from a Python virtual environment, simply type deactivate Example 2 # Create a virtual environment python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # Install beautifulsoup4 pip install beautifulsoup4 # Run the script python search_generator.py ./pages # Deactivate when done deactivate ⌘ Index ⌘ About ⌘ Colophon ⌘ Now ⌘ Search ⌘ RSS"
