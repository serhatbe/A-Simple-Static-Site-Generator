## Winget vs. Homebrew

**winget** (Windows Package Manager) is similar to **Homebrew**, but for Windows.

```
winget search <package>   # Find packages  
winget install <package>  # Install packages  
winget upgrade --all      # Update everything  
winget list               # See installed packages  
winget uninstall <package>  # Remove a package
```

### Similarities

- Both allow installing applications with a simple command (`winget install <package>` vs. `brew install <package>`).
- Both handle dependencies automatically.
- Both have repositories (Homebrew uses **Formulae & Casks**, while winget uses **Microsoft's package repository**).
- Both allow updating and uninstalling software efficiently.

### Differences

| Feature        | winget (Windows) | Homebrew (macOS/Linux) |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Platform** | Windows 10/11   | macOS, Linux |
| **Default Repository** | Microsoft package repository | Homebrew Formulae & Casks |
| **GUI App Support** | Yes (e.g., `winget install firefox`) | Yes (`brew install --cask firefox`) |
| **Installation** | Comes preinstalled in Windows 11, available for Windows 10 | Must be installed manually |
| **Software Sources** | Official Microsoft sources, community packages | Brew repository, community taps |

## Winget vs. Scoop

Scoop is an alternative package manager for Windows that focuses on developer tools and CLI utilities. It's like Homebrew but designed for Windows users who want a Unix-like package management experience.

### Differences

| Feature  | **winget** | **Scoop** |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Official support** | Microsoft-backed | Community-driven |
| **GUI app support** | Yes (e.g., `winget install vlc`) | Mostly CLI apps, but GUI apps via `extras` bucket |
| **Default install location** | System-wide (`C:\Program Files`) | User folder (`C:\Users\YourName\scoop`) |
| **Package update speed** | Sometimes delayed | Often faster updates |
| **Dependency handling** | Limited | Handles dependencies well |
| **Best for** | General users, GUI apps | Devs, CLI tools, portable apps |
