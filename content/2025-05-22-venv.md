The main difference is the virtual environment directory name and visibility. Both approaches work identically, they create isolated Python environments with their own packages and dependencies. The activation commands differ accordingly:

- `.venv/bin/activate` for the hidden version
- `venv/bin/activate` for the visible version

**`python3 -m venv .venv`** creates a hidden directory named `.venv` (the leading dot makes it hidden on Unix systems like macOS). When you run `ls` in your project directory, you won't see it unless you use `ls -a` to show hidden files.

**`python3 -m venv venv`** creates a visible directory named `venv` that will show up in normal directory listings.

Many developers prefer `.venv` because:

- It keeps the project directory cleaner visually
- It's less likely to be accidentally committed to version control (though you should add it to `.gitignore` either way)
- It follows the convention of hidden configuration files

## Example 1

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pyyaml
```

To exit from a Python virtual environment, simply type `deactivate`

## Example 2

```
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install beautifulsoup4
pip install beautifulsoup4

# Run the script
python search_generator.py ./pages

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```
