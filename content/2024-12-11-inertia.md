## Derivation of the Moment of Inertia of a Rectangle About Its Base

We calculate the **moment of inertia** of a rectangle about its **base**, where the base is along the $x$-axis and the height extends from $y = 0$ to $y = h$.

### 1. Moment of Inertia Formula

The formula for the moment of inertia is:

$$
I = \int y^2 \, dA
$$

Here:
- $y$: distance from the axis of rotation (the base of the rectangle in this case),
- $dA$: the infinitesimal area element.

### 2. Setup for the Rectangle

- The rectangle has a width of $b$ and height $h$.
- The height extends from $y = 0$ to $y = h$.
- The infinitesimal area element is $dA = b \, dy$.

The integral becomes:

$$
I_{\text{base}} = \int_{0}^{h} y^2 \, b \, dy
$$

### 3. Solve the Integral

Factor $b$ (constant width) outside of the integral:

$$
I_{\text{base}} = b \int_{0}^{h} y^2 \, dy
$$

The integral of $y^2$ is:

$$
\int y^2 \, dy = \frac{y^3}{3}
$$

Apply the limits $y = 0$ to $y = h$:

$$
I_{\text{base}} = b \left[ \frac{y^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{h}
$$

Substitute the limits:

$$
I_{\text{base}} = b \left( \frac{h^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} \right)
$$

Simplify:

$$
I_{\text{base}} = b \cdot \frac{h^3}{3}
$$

### 4. Final Result

The moment of inertia of a rectangle about its base is:

$$
I_{\text{base}} = \frac{b h^3}{3}
$$

### Comparison with the Centroidal Moment of Inertia

The moment of inertia about the base is four times greater than that about the centroidal $x$-axis:

$$
I_{\text{base}} = 4 \cdot I_{\text{centroidal}}
$$

where:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = \frac{b h^3}{12}
$$
