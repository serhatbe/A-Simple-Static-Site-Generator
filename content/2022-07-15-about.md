description: Continuum is a simple notes repository where I irregularly post my notes.

Continuum is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes, starting from May 15, 2023. However older notes, written before that date, are also archived.

I primarily write by hand as a means of processing my thoughts and enhancing my comprehension. These notes serve as a valuable reference for both the present and the future, and the daily practice of writing them has become a personal memory tool, especially as I age.
