description: Technical information about this website for the curious.

This website is generated using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). Here are the tools and technologies involved in building it. I hope *ℂ𝕠𝕟𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕦𝕦𝕞* has a personal, hand-crafted feel, even though some command-line tools were used in its creation:

- **Obsidian**: My primary note-taking app, used for writing in Markdown format.  
- **Bash**: A Unix command-line shell that automates tasks such as syncing files and building the website.  
- **Make**: A build automation tool that streamlines the website generation process.  
- **Pandoc**: Converts Markdown notes into HTML, making them web-ready.  
- **Zotero**: Manages references and citations, integrating seamlessly with Pandoc for scholarly writing.  
- **MathJax**: A JavaScript engine for rendering mathematical notation, enabling users to right-click expressions for options like copying the $\LaTeX$ code.  
- **Git**: A distributed version control system I’m learning to use for managing versions and collaborating effectively.  
- **rsync**: A fast, incremental file transfer tool that keeps my Obsidian and HTML folders in sync.
